# About

This application is designed to help in logging workouts.

## Desired Features:
- Timer that starts/stops.
- Add an exercise and record details or weight/reps (maybe have 2 categories).
- Add notes.
- Dashboard showing latest workouts.
- Page showing all workouts.
- Edit & update a workout.
- Delete a workout.

### Where I left off:


### Dugout Features (next up:
- Get search box to work.
- Get X latest workouts (can you paginate them all, or only most recent? What about large displays? Can you populate the width of the screen somehow?)

### Fix:
- Minor alignment issues with Workout icon.
- No floating footer when small mobile.

### Feature Upgrades to Build:
- "Leveling Up" of status, depending upon how many completed workouts exist. Presently, "Newbie" is first level. After 5 workouts, change it to "Novice" and so forth -- build a handful of different levels. This is a fun easter-egg feature/cool discovery.

- Allow users to select their own avatar icons. For now we'll use a generic icon, but in the future replace this with an "edit" button and modal window, so the user may upload their own.

**OR**

- User's avatars upgrade along with their status (see downloaded .AI file for a set of avatar images that could be used for various levels)
